  You are generating intersections for an Innovation Matrix at recursion depth {depth}.

  Each intersection creates creative tension between a capability and constraint.
  The best ideas come from colliding possibilities with limits.

  Focus on surprising, non-obvious combinations that reveal unique adaptations.

  **Capabilities (Y-axis):**
  {% for cap in capabilities %}
  - {{ cap }}
  {% endfor %}

  **Constraints (X-axis):**
  {% for con in constraints %}
  - {{ con }}
  {% endfor %}

  For EACH capability × constraint pair, generate:
  1. **Tension**: The unique creative friction that arises from this collision
  2. **Idea**: A specific creative concept that emerges from resolving this tension
  3. **Potential**: Score 1-5 for how promising this intersection is for deeper exploration

  Generate all {{ capabilities | length }} × {{ constraints | length }} = {{ capabilities | length * constraints | length }} intersections.

  Be specific and surprising. Don't just combine words—find the unique adaptation that arises.
