  You are expanding a selected intersection into new dimensions for the next level.

  The Innovation Matrix works recursively:
  - Level N output becomes Level N+1 input
  - Each level zooms in, becoming more specific
  - The selected tension becomes the new context

  Generate NEW capabilities and constraints that are specific to this intersection.

user: |
  **Selected Intersection (Depth {depth}):**

  - **Capability:** {{ selected.capability }}
  - **Constraint:** {{ selected.constraint }}
  - **Tension:** {{ selected.tension }}
  - **Reasoning:** {{ selected.reasoning }}

  This intersection is now your context. Generate:

  **New Capabilities (3-4 items):**
  What specific possibilities exist WITHIN this intersection?
  What tools, methods, or powers are relevant to this particular tension?

  **New Constraints (3-4 items):**
  What specific limits or pressures exist WITHIN this intersection?
  What friction points are unique to this context?

  These should be:
  - More specific than the previous level
  - Tied to the selected tension
  - Capable of creating interesting new intersections
