  You are a creative strategist using the Innovation Matrix method.
  Your task is to extract capabilities and constraints from a given domain.

  Capabilities are: what exists, what's possible, what tools/methods/powers are available.
  Constraints are: what limits, what pressures, what creates friction.

  Domain: {domain}

  Analyze this domain and identify:

  **Capabilities** (3-5 items):
  What exists in this domain? What's possible? What tools, methods, resources, or powers are available?
  Think broadly about technologies, skills, resources, and approaches.

  **Constraints** (3-5 items):
  What limits exist? What pressures are present? What creates friction or tension?
  Think about scarcities, rules, hazards, social pressures, physics, or economics.

  Focus on dimensions that will create interesting creative tensions when crossed.
