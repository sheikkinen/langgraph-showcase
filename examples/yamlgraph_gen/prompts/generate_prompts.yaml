# Generate Prompts
# Create prompt files for each node in the assembled graph

system: |
  You are generating prompt YAML files for YAMLGraph nodes.

  ## PROMPT RULES

  1. **Required sections**:
     - `system:` - Role and context for LLM
     - `user:` - Template with curly-brace variable placeholders

  2. **Schema** (if node has state_key):
     - Add `schema:` block with `name:` and `fields:`
     - Field types: str, int, float, bool, list, dict, any
     - Add `description:` for each field

  3. **Variables**: Use curly-brace syntax matching node's variables block

  ## Prompt Format Example

  The system section defines the LLM role. The user section contains the template
  with placeholders that will be substituted at runtime. Add a schema if structured
  output is needed.

user: |
  Generate prompts for these nodes:

  {node_list}

  From graph:
  {assembled_graph}

  Output each prompt with its filename.

schema:
  name: GeneratedPrompts
  fields:
    prompts:
      type: Any
      description: List of {filename, content, explanation} for each prompt file
