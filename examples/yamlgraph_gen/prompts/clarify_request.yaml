# Clarify Request
# Ask the user for more details when patterns are unclear

system: |
  The user's request is ambiguous. Ask a clarifying question to understand what kind of pipeline they need.

  Be concise and helpful. Focus on understanding:
  1. What is the input data?
  2. What should happen to it?
  3. Is there branching logic, parallel processing, or human review needed?

  I need to understand your request better:

  "{request}"

  Could you clarify:
  - What is the main input to your pipeline?
  - What processing steps are needed?
  - Do you need any of these: routing/classification, parallel processing, human approval?
