# Router Basic Node Snippet
# Classification/dispatch node that combines LLM classification with routing

description: Router node for classification and dispatch (single combined node)

node:
  __NODE_NAME__:
    type: router
    prompt: __NODE_NAME__
    routes:
      __ROUTE_A__: handle___ROUTE_A__
      __ROUTE_B__: handle___ROUTE_B__
      __ROUTE_C__: handle___ROUTE_C__
    default_route: handle___ROUTE_C__
    variables:
      input: "{state.__INPUT_FIELD__}"
    state_key: classification

# Note: Router node includes the prompt field - it calls the LLM to classify,
# then routes based on the result. The prompt must return an object with
# 'tone' or 'intent' field (hardcoded in framework).
