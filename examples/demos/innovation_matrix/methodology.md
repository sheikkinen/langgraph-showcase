# The Innovation Matrix

A systematic method for generating creative ideas by crossing **Capabilities** with **Constraints**.

## Core Principle

Innovation happens at intersections. When you cross what's possible (capabilities) with what's limiting (constraints), you create **creative tension** that forces novel solutions.

```
                 CONSTRAINTS
              ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
              │  A  │  B  │  C  │
         ┌────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
    C    │ X  │ X∩A │ X∩B │ X∩C │
    A    ├────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
    P    │ Y  │ Y∩A │ Y∩B │ Y∩C │
    A    ├────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
    B    │ Z  │ Z∩A │ Z∩B │ Z∩C │
         └────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘

Each cell = a creative intersection to explore
```

## The Method

### Step 1: Define Dimensions

**Capabilities** (Y-axis): What exists, what's possible, what tools are available
- Technologies, skills, resources, powers, methods

**Constraints** (X-axis): What limits, what pressures, what creates friction
- Scarcities, rules, hazards, social pressures, physics

### Step 2: Fill the Matrix

For each intersection, ask: *"What emerges when this capability meets this constraint?"*

Don't just combine words—find the **unique adaptation** that arises from the collision.

### Step 3: Select & Expand

Not all cells are interesting. Select the most promising intersections and expand them:
- What are the implications?
- Who would exist here?
- What conflicts arise?

## The Recursive Principle

The output of one matrix becomes the input to the next.

```
Level N Output → Level N+1 Input
     ↓
    More specific, more detailed
```

Each level zooms in, using the creative tensions from the previous level as new capabilities or constraints.

## Example: Generic → Specific

### Level 0: Abstract
| | Scarcity | Danger | Social Pressure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Technology** | Tech rationing | Weaponized tech | Tech as status |
| **Magic** | Magic costs | Magic corrupts | Magic taboos |
| **Nature** | Resource wars | Predator world | Sacred lands |

**Select:** "Magic corrupts" → expand this intersection

### Level 1: Setting
Now "Magic corrupts" becomes the context. New matrix:

| | Personal cost | Social cost | Environmental cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Healing** | Healer ages | Village shuns healer | Land withers |
| **Combat** | Warrior hollows | Fear of mages | Battlefields cursed |
| **Knowledge** | Mind fragments | Secrets isolate | Libraries toxic |

**Select:** "Warrior hollows" → expand this intersection

### Level 2: Scene
Now we have a hollowed warrior in a world where combat magic corrupts. New matrix:

| | Combat | Diplomacy | Escape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hollow needs** | Uses corruption as weapon | Trades corruption for favor | Corruption spreads |
| **Enemy knows** | Provokes to trigger | Negotiates carefully | Blocks exits |
| **Time pressure** | Each spell worsens | Patience vs urgency | Corruption countdown |

Each cell is now a **specific dramatic moment**.

## Why It Works

1. **Forces collision** — Avoids generic ideas by requiring specific tensions
2. **Systematic exploration** — Covers possibility space methodically
3. **Recursively deepens** — Each level adds specificity without losing coherence
4. **Reusable structure** — Same method applies to any creative domain

## Applications

| Domain | Capabilities | Constraints |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **RPG Design** | Magic, Tech, Society | Physics, Scarcity, Hazards |
| **Story Writing** | Character wants, Plot types | Genre rules, Theme requirements |
| **Product Design** | Features, Technologies | Cost, UX, Regulations |
| **Strategy** | Resources, Competencies | Market forces, Competition |

## Key Insight

> The best ideas don't come from **adding features**.
> They come from **colliding possibilities with limits**.

The Innovation Matrix systematizes this collision.
