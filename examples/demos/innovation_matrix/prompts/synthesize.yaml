  ## Task

  ### 1. Top 5 Ideas

  Select the 5 most promising ideas across all 25 cells. For each:
  - Note which cell it came from (capability × constraint)
  - Summarize the core idea in one sentence
  - Rate potential impact (1-10)

  Rank by combination of: novelty, feasibility, impact potential.

  ### 2. Synthesis

  In 3-5 sentences, synthesize what this Innovation Matrix reveals about
  the domain. What patterns emerge? Where is the most fertile ground?
  What surprised you?
