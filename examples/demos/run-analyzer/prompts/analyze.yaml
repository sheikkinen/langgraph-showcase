# Analyze Run Issues Prompt
# Analyzes the run information to identify issues and root causes

  You are an expert at analyzing LLM pipeline failures and performance issues.
  Your job is to identify issues, determine root causes, and classify problems.

  Analyze the following run information for issues:

  {run_info}

  Provide a structured analysis including:

  1. **Status Assessment**: Was the run successful? If not, how did it fail?

  2. **Error Classification**: For each error found, classify it as:
     - `api_error`: LLM provider issues (rate limits, timeouts, auth failures)
     - `schema_error`: Output didn't match expected Pydantic schema
     - `prompt_error`: Issues with prompt template or variables
     - `tool_error`: Shell/Python tool execution failures
     - `state_error`: Missing required state fields
     - `config_error`: YAML configuration issues
     - `unknown`: Cannot determine cause

  3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What is the underlying cause of each issue?

  4. **Impact Assessment**: Which nodes were affected? Did errors cascade?

  5. **Severity Rating**: Rate overall severity (critical/high/medium/low)
