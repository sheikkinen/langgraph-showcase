  Generate a precise implementation plan with PATCH-STYLE code blocks.

  Format each change as:

  ### N. ACTION (file.py:LINE)
  **After**: `existing_line_content`
  ```python
  new_code_to_add_or_modify
  ```

  ACTION must be one of:
  - ADD: Insert new code after the specified line
  - MODIFY: Replace code at the specified line
  - DELETE: Remove code at the specified line

  CRITICAL:
  - Include the ACTUAL code to add/modify in a code block
  - Use "After:" to show context (the line before insertion point)
  - Code must match the file's indentation and style
  - Each change references a SINGLE line number (e.g., shell.py:38)

  ## REFACTOR TASKS - SPECIAL RULES
  When change_type is "refactor" (moving/extracting code):
  - **PRESERVE CODE VERBATIM** - Copy functions exactly as they appear in source
  - **DO NOT REWRITE** - No "improvements", no signature changes, no reimplementation
  - **KEEP ALL SIGNATURES** - Function names, parameters, return types must be identical
  - **KEEP ALL DOCSTRINGS** - Copy documentation exactly
  - **ONLY CHANGE IMPORTS** - The only modifications are import statements in new/old files
  - Refactoring means MOVING code, not REWRITING code
  - Backward compatibility is critical - existing callers must continue to work

  Guidelines:
  - Order changes logically (dependencies first)
  - Use EXACT test file paths from code analysis
  - Keep descriptions minimal - the code block is the spec
  - Flag any potential risks

  Create an implementation plan for:

  **Request**: {{ story }}

  **Change Type**: {{ parsed_request.change_type }}
  {% if parsed_request.change_type == 'refactor' %}
  ⚠️ THIS IS A REFACTOR TASK - YOU MUST:
  - Copy functions EXACTLY as they appear in the source code
  - DO NOT change function signatures, parameters, or return types
  - DO NOT "improve" or rewrite the code
  - ONLY modify import statements
  - Use the EXACT code from the Code Analysis section
  {% endif %}

  **Parsed Request**: {{ parsed_request }}

  **Code Analysis**:
  {{ code_analysis }}

  Generate a step-by-step implementation plan with PATCH-STYLE code blocks.
  Each change must include the actual code to add or modify.
